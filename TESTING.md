## Bugs

**Fixed Bugs**

| Bug | Status |
| --- | --- |
| I was encountering a bug with the link to add a blogpost when the user is an administrator. The paged had to be refreshed for it to appear (or disappear if the user is not an administrator.) To fix that I added window.location.reload() to refresh the page upon sign in or sign up. | Fixed |

## Unfixed Bugs


- I have an unfixed bug related to the profiles_id. The link to the profile in the Post component leads to the profile with the previous id than the one in the link. I am suspecting that this happened when at some point I tried to import data from the local environment of my api to heroku, or when I deleted users from the backend. I have not found how it was caused and the rest of the app works fine it is just the link in the Post that has this problem. A quick fix to this was to add 1 to the url that user is requesting. Even though this is not really a solution it fixed the problem for now. Further debugging in the future is going to be needed.
